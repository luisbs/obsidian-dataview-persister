# TODO

## Tasks

- [ ] Add `SettingsTab`
- [ ] Allow to disable persisting on file focus change.
- [ ] Add support for executing `dataviewjs` queries.

### Fixes

- [ ] Ensure that `this` is correctly referenced on queries execution.
- [ ] Ensure vault has been indexed by dataview before executing to avoid removing previously persisted results.
- [ ] Allow the command `persist-file` to be executed on **Read Mode**.
